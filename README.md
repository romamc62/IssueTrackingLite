# IssueTrackingLite
Using the tutorial [https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/scenebuilder/1/get_started/jsbpub-get_started.htm](https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/scenebuilder/1/get_started/jsbpub-get_started.htm), we made
an issue tracker for people to use in project development. It allows you to give a quick overview of the project, a more detailed description,
and gives a table used to list out all the issues. Users can add or delete issues from the table, as well as save changes.
